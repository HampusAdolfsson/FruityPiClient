# FruityPiClient
An example Visual c++ client for the FruityPi server, see: https://github.com/HampusAdolfsson/FruityPi

Includes a small library for communicating with a FruityPi server, and a client program that visualizes the data from an audio input device using that library. If your audio card allows you to create a loopback device, you can use this to visualize the audio output from a computer on an RGB strip.
